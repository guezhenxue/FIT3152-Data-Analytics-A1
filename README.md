The analysis focuses on Andorra (AND) as the target country, leveraging the World Values Survey (Wave 7) dataset and Global Health Security Index (GHSI) data. Key tasks include:

1. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, imputation, and variable classification (categorical/numerical).

2. Comparative Analysis: Comparing Andorra's survey responses with other countries using visualizations (boxplots, correlation matrices).

3. Predictive Modeling: Linear regression to identify significant predictors of institutional confidence.

4. Clustering: K-means clustering on GHSI data to group countries by health security metrics.

Tools Used: R (tidyverse, ggplot2, cluster), with generative AI (ChatGPT) for R code assistance (documented in Appendix).

Key Findings:

Andorra's institutional confidence is strongly predicted by neighborhood trust (TNeighbourhood) and life satisfaction (PSatisfied).

Health security clustering placed Andorra with countries like Iran and Nicaragua.
